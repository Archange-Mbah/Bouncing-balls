# Bounce
-An example of what Bounce.java generates

 

 In this repository, we have three three main files in the lib folder:
 --Bounce.java
 -Ballsbouncing.java
 -Stern.java
 
 1) Bounce.java
   - When we run launch this file in the terminal of an IDE, we can see a moving ball, been reflected by the sides of the window.
   - It can be launched using the pfad of the file and adding  java -cp core.jar Bounce.java  .
